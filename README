Custom git server docker instance. 
To build and then run:

$ make
$ make run

If you want it to run, even on reboot

$ make deploy

And if you want to stop it, use the docker stop command 


Make sure you have the following other files:

keys/        <- put keys and such in here
data/        <- should be owned by an admin: This is where the git data goes
caddyfolder/ <- should be owned by www-data: This is where caddy puts certs.
                no files here should be visible by users, so git misses them
