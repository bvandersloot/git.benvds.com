Hello! Welcome to my Git server!

You can clone any of these repos in a reasonable way, but all of them are read-only. If you want to push anything back to these repos, let me know (admin@benvds.com). I can either get you an account, refer you to a GitHub mirror, or set up a GitHub mirror.

Example: 
$ git clone https://git.benvds.com/git/example-repo
