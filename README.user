Welcome to the inside of my Git server!

All of the repos here live at the folder ~/git 
This is just a symbolic link to /srv, but for your convenience.
Access control is done entirely with Unix primitives like the octal file 
permissions and user and group ownership. 
Don't put anything in ~/git you don't want the world to see, unless you change
the file permissions, of course. 
The folder ~/git is served to the public over HTTPS at git.benvds.com

if you have appropriate permissions, creating a repo is simple:

$ mkdir example-repo
$ cd example-repo
$ git init

then pull it down wherever you want.
Cloning repos can be done over HTTPS for write only or by using:

$ git clone $user@git.benvds.com:git/example-repo

if the repo is in ~/git/example-repo


If the repo is being used over SSH, you should have push access!
